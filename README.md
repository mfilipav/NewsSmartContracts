# NewsSmartContracts
Ethereum blockchain smart contract, tied to each content piece, records the transaction history of that content piece individually in a transparent and immutable manner.

Benefits of smart contracts for news media :
- pay media content creators via block chain
- store the content as decentralized encrypted files which can be unlocked only by a private key
- for the content users rights can be sliced and diced in multiple ways
- keep track of how many times a particular content was used by news-agency clients


How does it work? [figure]
DApp with an ETH smart contract at its core, which facilitates secure creator-to-user transations on the Ethereum blockchain
Content is managed by Media Express API --> content gets hashed 
Contract looks like this --> SHOW CONTRACT FIGURE
Deploy smart contract to Ethereum Blockchain
Interface the DApp with web application through smart contract's ABI

1. Creators submit content (text, image, video) to MediaExpress API?

2. User selects desired content (or piece of it, think one paragraph or video snippet) from MediaExpress API
3. and pays for it with ETH tokens
4. tokens are deposited to creator's wallet
5. each time this particular piece of content is used -- author gets paid


How our solution defies competition:
- currently there are no alternative solutions
- decentralized platform acts as a trust layer for the internet, so no intermediary/3rd party is needed

Future:
- Payments can be held in escrow in a smart contact at the start of an assignment, to be released on successful completion of work.
