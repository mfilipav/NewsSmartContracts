# Smart Contracts to Monetize Media Content
Ethereum blockchain smart contract, tied to individual piece of news media content, records the transaction history of content between authors and consumers, in a transparent and immutable manner.
![SMART CONTRACT SOLUTION PROPOSAL](https://github.com/mfilipav/NewsSmartContracts/blob/master/misc/img2.jpg)

*Developed for Thompson Reuters challenge at Hack'n'Lead Hackathon, which took place in Zurich on June 16-17, 2018.*

## Benefits of ETH smart contracts for monetizing news media:
  - pay media content creators via block chain in a secure manner
  - for the content users rights can be sliced and diced in multiple ways
  - keep track of how many times a particular content was used by news-agency clients
  - ensure information provenance
  - store the content as decentralized encrypted files which can be unlocked only by a private hashed key

## How does it work?
DApp with an ETH smart contract at its core, which facilitates secure creator-to-user transations on the Ethereum blockchain
Content is managed by Media Express API.
  - Deploy smart contract to Ethereum Blockchain
  - Interface the DApp with web application through smart contract's ABI
  - Creators submit content (text, image, video) to MediaExpress API
  - User selects desired content (or piece of it, think one paragraph or video snippet) from MediaExpress API
  - ..and pays for it with ETH tokens
  - tokens are deposited to creator's wallet
  - each time this particular piece of content is used, author gets paid royalties to their wallet

## How our solution defies competition:
- currently there are no alternative solutions
- decentralized platform acts as a trust layer for the internet, so no intermediary/3rd party is needed

## Future:
- Payments can be held in escrow in a smart contact at the start of an assignment, to be released on successful completion of work.
